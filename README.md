# SubAquatica Hub

This is just a simple website built with Vite React.

![Screenshot of the webpage and how it looks when it is opened in a browser](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1qHSS5TcZUX4guL_3cftLCLIvJ31XhMvi)

## Purpose

Its purpose is to help me learn to use React.

## What it includes

The project is a single-page website that provides information on various courses one can sign up for, reviews and a simple form where one can leave their contact information. Most of the text provided is "dummy" text and the forms do not work. The page serves purely as an exercise.

It includes [swiper](https://swiperjs.com/) displaying various courses and reviews. It also has [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) which animates parts of the page.
